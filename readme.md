## Extensionist

This site is me taking a crack at improving the PHP pecl kind of site. We have Packagist for downloading and managing
packages, but not really any solutions for managing extensions, so this is an initial crack at developing a website
for showing all available extensions for PHP.

## TODO

1. Develop admin system for storing package references to github, bitbucket, custom urls, etc
2. Develop Composer Plugin to use composer for managing extensions as well (if possible)
3. Develop some sort of Build Automation where you choose the settings and the server compiles the *.dll's or *.so's
4. Implement Solr or Custom Search to show registered extensions
